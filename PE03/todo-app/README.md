# Input
The user provides input in two primary ways: typing text into the input field to describe a new ToDo item and clicking buttons. Specifically, the "Add Task" button is clicked to submit a new ToDo, and "Delete" buttons associated with individual ToDo items are clicked to remove them from the list.

# Process
The React application manages a todos state array, which holds objects representing each ToDo item (with a unique ID and text). When the user types, the inputValue state updates. Clicking "Add Task" triggers a function that creates a new ToDo object, adds it to a new todos array (using the spread operator for immutability), and clears the input. Clicking a "Delete" button filters the todos array, creating a new array without the deleted item.

# Output
The application dynamically renders the ToDo list based on the current todos state. The output includes: an input field for new tasks, an "Add Task" button, and a list of current ToDo items. Each displayed ToDo item features its description and a "Delete" button. The UI updates in real-time as tasks are added or removed, reflecting the current state of the ToDo list.
