# MyResume

## Input

The primary input for this program is the user's resume data, which is directly embedded within the `Resume.js` React component. This includes personal information, educational background, a list of technical skills, detailed work experience, and descriptions of personal projects. Additionally, styling preferences such as background colors, font styles, and layout adjustments are provided as input through the `Resume.css` file.

## Process

The core of the program's operation lies in its processing phase, driven by React's component-based architecture. The `App.js` file serves as the entry point, importing and rendering the `Resume` component. Within `Resume.js`, the structured resume data is processed and transformed into a hierarchy of HTML elements. Concurrently, `Resume.css` is processed by the browser, applying the defined styles to these HTML elements. This ensures that the raw data is rendered with the specified visual presentation, including the lime background and black text, and adheres to the desired layout and typography.

## Output

The final output is a fully interactive and responsive web page displaying the user's professional resume. This output is presented in a clean, organized, and visually appealing format, accessible through any modern web browser. The content is clearly segmented into distinct sections (Header, Summary, Employment, Internships, Projects, Education, Skills), making it easy to navigate and read. The consistent styling ensures a professional and cohesive look, effectively showcasing the user's qualifications and experience.
